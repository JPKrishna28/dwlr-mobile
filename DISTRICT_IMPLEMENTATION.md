Your app now supports proper district selection with:

- **Krishna District** 🏞️
  - Table: `water_levels` (existing table)
  - Color: Blue (#2563eb)
  - Description: Krishna District monitoring station

- **Eluru District** 🌾  
  - Table: `water_levels2` (new table to create)
  - Color: Green (#059669)
  - Description: Eluru District monitoring station

### 📱 **Updated Screens**

1. **CitySelectionScreen.js**
   - Changed from generic "City 1/City 2" to "Krishna District/Eluru District"
   - Updated icons: 🏞️ for Krishna, 🌾 for Eluru
   - Updated all text references to use "district" instead of "city"

2. **HomeScreen.js**

   - District names display properly in header

3. **ChartScreen.js**
   - Updated loading messages to reference "district monitoring station"
   - Charts will show district-specific data

### 📊 **Database Requirements**

You need to create the Eluru District table in Supabase:

```sql
-- Create table for Eluru District
CREATE TABLE water_levels2 (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    water_level NUMERIC,
    pressure NUMERIC,
    temperature NUMERIC,
    battery_level NUMERIC,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE water_levels2 ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON water_levels2
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert access for authenticated users" ON water_levels2
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Enable real-time subscriptions
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE water_levels2;
```

### 🎨 **User Experience**

1. **Login → District Selection**
   - After logging in, users see a beautiful district selection screen
   - Cards show "Krishna District" and "Eluru District" with appropriate icons

2. **Data Isolation**
   - Krishna District shows data from `water_levels` table
   - Eluru District shows data from `water_levels2` table
   - Real-time updates work independently for each district

3. **Easy Switching**
   - Users can switch districts using the header button
   - Visual indicators show selected district

### 📁 **New Documentation**

Created `DISTRICT_SETUP.md` with:
- Complete setup instructions
- SQL commands for database creation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Instructions for adding more districts

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Create Eluru District Table**
   - Run the SQL commands above in your Supabase dashboard
   - Add some test data for Eluru District

2. **Test the App**
