# 🎉 Multi-Station Setup Complete!

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented**

### 🏗️ **New Architecture**

Your app now has a **two-level selection system**:

1. **District Level** → Choose between Eluru and Krishna
2. **Station Level** → Choose specific monitoring station within district

### 📊 **Station Distribution**

#### 🌾 **Eluru District** (2 stations)
- **Eluru Station 1** → `water_levels` table ✅
- **Eluru Station 2** → `water_levels2` table ✅

#### 🏞️ **Krishna District** (2 stations)  
- **Krishna Station 1** → `water_levels3` table 🆕
- **Krishna Station 2** → `water_levels4` table 🆕

### 🎨 **Enhanced User Experience**

#### **District Selection Screen**
- Beautiful cards for each district
- Shows number of available stations
- Color-coded: Green for Eluru, Blue for Krishna
- District-specific icons: 🌾 for Eluru, 🏞️ for Krishna

#### **Station Selection Screen**
- Lists all stations within selected district
- Back button to return to district selection
- Clear station names and descriptions
- Shows table name for technical reference

#### **Navigation Flow**
1. **Login** → Authentication screen
2. **Districts** → Choose Eluru or Krishna
3. **Stations** → Choose specific monitoring station
4. **Data** → View charts and readings
5. **Switch** → Easy switching between districts/stations

### 🛠️ **Database Requirements**

You need to create these new tables in Supabase:

```sql
-- Krishna Station 1
CREATE TABLE water_levels3 (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    water_level NUMERIC,
    pressure NUMERIC,
    temperature NUMERIC,
    battery_level NUMERIC,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Krishna Station 2  
CREATE TABLE water_levels4 (
    id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    water_level NUMERIC,
    pressure NUMERIC,
    temperature NUMERIC,
    battery_level NUMERIC,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 🔄 **Smart Features**

#### **Automatic Detection**
- App checks which tables exist in database
- Only shows districts/stations with available tables
- Graceful handling of missing tables

#### **Real-time Updates**
- Each station has independent real-time subscriptions
- Data updates automatically when changes occur
- No interference between different stations

#### **Data Isolation**
- Complete separation between stations
- Charts show only selected station's data
- No data mixing between different locations
